### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a statistician with a specialty in biomedical applications. I'm passionate about using data science to solve challenges in public health and improve decision-making in business.

My work has been published in a variety of clinical and scientific journals including *Brain*, *Alzheimerâ€™s and Dementia*, *NeuroImage*, *Pulmonary Circulation*, and *CHEST* (for an up-to-date list, see my [Google Scholar Page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TxEcZMMAAAAJ&hl=en)).

My expertise is in analyzing and modeling complex datasets, including missing information, survival outcomes, and correlated data. I received my Masterâ€™s in Biostatistics from the University of Colorado (Denver) in 2023. I'm currently located in Pittsburgh, PA.
